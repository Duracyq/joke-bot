# joke-bot
this bot uses JokeAPI to generate jokes (easy to think abt it)

link to project: https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/joke-telling-bot-web-app-cjd2eyrfak

## Requirements
- Set up a React App (vanilla JS or your favorite framework works too)
- Create a button for the user to generate a random joke
- Once the button is clicked, the website will tell the user a random joke
- Allow the user to change the language and/or accents of the voice assistant


### For an extra challenge

    Allow the user to hear a joke simply by pressing 'J'
    Allow the user to hear a joke by saying 'Tell Me A Joke' to the voice assistant
